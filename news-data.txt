TIFU by bringing up the Ukraine situation with my parents,t2_8kcfkqt1,tifu,So me and my parents are polar opposite when it come to politics, and at this point, basic value. We had argued for quite some time on the ccp and human rights problem before (around 2019 with the movement/protest/riot in hk, depending on your pov), and they are on full support for the ccp. That ended by no one shall bring up the topic ever again. 

Today, I forgot my parent's political views and talked about the Ukraine situation, you know, because it is the most serious thing happening and the whole situation is so fucked up. Both my parents' responses on that is that they are on full support for Putin, and that "Zelenskyy did wrong by siding with the US and pissing off Russia and he deserved it" and more.

Talking to them feels like facebook conspiracy post IRL and I am both disappointed at my parents' take on stuff like this and at myself for not keeping my mouth shut in this kind of setting. 

Edit: we are Chinese living in Hong Kong. 

TL;DR : I brought up the Ukraine situation and both my parents turn into Facebook conspiracy theorists and full Putin supporters mode,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/t1t8zt/tifu_by_bringing_up_the_ukraine_situation_with_my/

ELI5 : how are we sure that we all see the same colors ?,t2_hnxwj,explainlikeimfive,I'm not sure how should I phrase it but lets give it a try.

How are we sure that the color I see as green, for exemple, is the same color as someone else's green? 

Is it possible that the color I call green is an other color for someone else's eyes but we name it the same because we grew up with people naming this color "green"?
I really hope im being clear enough,https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/t1um4e/eli5_how_are_we_sure_that_we_all_see_the_same/

I am secretly my boyfriends live stream viewers…..,t2_jao0r15i,TrueOffMyChest,My boyfriend has just started streaming and he seems pretty excited about it. He didn’t buy a whole set up yet but live streams whenever he is on. I streamed briefly and know how hard it is to get viewers. I open multiple private browsers on my personal laptop, work laptop and phone - this way I can have his stream going and it counts as multiple viewers. When he saw 4, he was stoked. It’s only 4 viewers but he was so happy. There’s very little in this world right now that can cause that genuine happiness and expression. I sit on the other side of the couch with the volume down on all devices and just pretend I’m doing school work.

EDIT: wow! I appreciate the kind comments. I haven’t shared his link because the purpose of this post was to get something off my chest and not “farm subs”. I believe he is capable of it on his own, it’s just to keep him motivated and I have already shared with friends/family. I also don’t want him to find out. He plays Warzone/vanguard, perhaps you’ll come across his stream in the future. He streams on twitch. I give him 4 viewers not 1,000.
